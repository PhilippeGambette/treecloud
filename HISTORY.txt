TreeCloud
[+ new features]
[- corrected bugs]

# 2009/13/12 1.3:
+ word-focused coloring of the tree cloud (thanks J.M. Viprey!)
+ possibility to use a custom word list to display in the tree cloud
+ possibility to use custom color and size lists for the words in the tree cloud
+ possibility to view the tree cloud in Dendroscope (if words without special characters, thanks Daniel!)
- possibility to use whitespaces in name files (thanks Sébastien!)

# 2009/06/09 1.2:
+ cooccurrence computation in windows separated by a special character (suggested by D. Barrowcliff)
- correction of Linux line ending bug (thanks Nicolas!)
- correction of negative colors

# 2009/04/24 1.1:
+ new distance formula: ngd (Normalized Google Distance)
+ new text alteration method: random block deletion
+ new word selection: load custom word list
+ possibility to load a distance matrix
- correction RF-distance: removed trivial splits from computation

# 2009/03/30 1.0:
